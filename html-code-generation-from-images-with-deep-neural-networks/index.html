                            Writing code in a programming language for a designed mockup or a graphical user interface
                            created by designers and UI engineers is done mainly by developers to build and develop
                            custom websites and software. The development work is not approachable to those unfamiliar
                            with programming. To drive these personas capable of designing and developing the code bases
                            and website structures, we come up with an automated system. In this work, we have proposed
                            a model that will use various techniques of deep learning and computer vision to generate
                            HTML code from a single input mockup image. In addition, we have tried to build an
                            end-to-end automated system for developing web pages with accuracy more than the previous
                            methods.

                            <strong>The Problem</strong> <br>
                            The essence of the issue lies in the repetitiveness and complexity of translating visual
                            designs into coded and functional web pages. Each component, from buttons to text boxes,
                            must be individually converted into HTML elements, a process that becomes exponentially more
                            challenging with the scale of the website. Stakeholders, particularly those without a
                            programming background, find themselves sidelined and unable to contribute actively to the
                            development phase. They are also bogged down by endless meetings discussing small design
                            changes, significantly slowing down the deployment process.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Innovating solution through research!</strong> <br>
                        <p>Recognizing these challenges, our work began with an extensive review of existing literature
                            and methodologies in this field. We analyzed various approaches and understood their
                            limitations in terms of generalization, context learning, and handling complex design
                            structures. These models, while groundbreaking, faced issues with overfitting and were
                            restricted by the sequential nature of their architectures, limiting their efficiency and
                            scalability. Our exploration didn't stop there; we also explored machine translation
                            techniques, particularly in image captioning and description generation, drawing parallels
                            between translating visual content into human language and structured code.
                        </p>

                        <strong>The model architecture</strong>
                        <p>At the core of our system is the neural network; of course, that is doing the actual work.
                            The process begins with autoencoders, a specialized neural network that compresses images
                            into a compact, essential representation, stripping away redundancies while preserving the
                            core structure necessary for code generation. But our model doesn't stop there. After the
                            autoencoder, the input advances towards the 'main model,' a sophisticated structure where
                            the actual translation occurs. By integrating the insights from the autoencoders with
                            complex sequential and recurrent neural networks, the model maps out and understands the
                            correlation between visual elements and their corresponding code structures. The beauty of
                            this design lies in its attention to detail. While the autoencoders focus on images, the
                            main model also takes into account DSL (Domain-Specific Language), an intermediate coding
                            language that bridges the gap between graphic design and HTML code. This dual-input approach
                            ensures a comprehensive understanding of the task at hand, leading to remarkably accurate
                            code generation.</p>

                            The inference involves a unique intermediate step that plays a crucial role in the accuracy
                            and efficiency of code generation: the use of Domain Specific Language code. When our model
                            analyzes an input image, it doesn't immediately give out HTML code. Instead, it crafts what
                            we refer to as 'intermediary form' or DSL. This language, specific to the domain of web
                            layouts, represents various page elements in a simplified manner. For instance, instead of
                            generating a complete header tag filled with HTML content, the model produces a concise DSL
                            command. But why add this extra step? The answer lies in the complexity of web design.
                            Directly translating an image into HTML code places an immense contextual learning load on
                            the model, increasing the risk of errors and the memorization of code rather than proper
                            understanding. DSL, with its more straightforward commands, eases this burden significantly.
                            By abstracting the design's essence, our model can focus on accurately interpreting the
                            layout's structure and elements without getting halted by the intricacies of HTML syntax.
