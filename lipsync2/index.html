        <h3>The Bigger Question!</h3>
        <p align="justify">Why do we call it lipsync2? Where's the first one if this is the second...? The answer is
            that this is our second model in the series of lip synchronization models. The first one was a great
            success, but it had its limitations, which we've overcome in this version. We've made it more accurate, more
            robust, and more efficient.</p>

        <h3>The Result</h3>

            <div id="wrap"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSf1JBZff5E?rel=0" frameborder="0"
                    allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style="width: 600px;" height="400px"></iframe>

            <br>
            <hr boader="1">
            <p align="justify">Starting on an immersive experience with our lip synchronization model, where we set new
                standards in the creation of videos that generate faces talking with accurate lip movements. lipsync2 is
                our answer to the challenges left unsolved in previous works. The first big win is getting the
                synchronization of lips and speech just right. It's a game-changer because this is the key to making the
                characters in the videos convincing. If the lip movements are off, the whole video feels fake, isn't it?
                Therefore, that is what we have managed to reduce. However, the magic of lipsync2 does not end with
                lip-syncing. What makes it extra special is its ability to understand and replicate the full range of
                facial movements from the original video. It is not just about getting the words right; it is about
                preserving the complete expressions and personality. This attention to detail means the end product is
                not just a tedious avatar but a true reflection of the individual's unique way of speaking and
                expression.</p>

            <p align="justify"> <strong>What's more!</strong><br>
                Well, lipsync2 is a good performer when it comes to long audio sequences. Previously, models, especially
                ours, would lack when the audio track was too lengthy, messing up the sync and disrupting the video
                realism. That problem is now in our history. Lipsync2 handles long signals of speech with ease, keeping
                everything in sync and maintaining a smooth, natural feel throughout.</p>

            <p align="justify">
                But there is even more to it. This project wasn't just about fixing bugs or an increment to the
                previous; it was about taking the whole work to a new level. We looked at all the feedback from the
                first version and used it to make something not just better but innovative. We are talking about a tool
                that transforms the way we produce and perceive digital and personalized communication, making it more
                vivid and enjoyable.</p>
