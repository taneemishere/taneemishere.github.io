                Writing code in a programming language for a designed mockup or a graphical
                user interface created by designers and UI engineers, is done mostly by developers to build and develop
                custom websites and software. The development work is not approachable by those unfamiliar with
                programming, to drive these personas capable of designing and developing the code bases and website
                structures we come up with an automated system. In this work, we have proposed a model which will use
                various techniques of deep learning and computer vision to generate HTML code from a single input
                mock-up
                image. In addition, we have tried to build an end-to-end automated system for developing web pages with
                accuracy more than the previous methods. {The code is availlabe <a

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">the problem!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                The essence of the issue lies in the repetitiveness and complexity of translating visual designs
                into coded and functional web pages. Each component, from buttons to text boxes, must be individually
                converted into
                HTML elements, a process that becomes exponentially more challenging with the scale of the website.
                Stakeholders, particularly those without a programming background, find themselves sidelined, unable to
                contribute actively to the development phase. They are also bogged down by endless meetings discussing
                small design changes, significantly slowing down the deployment process.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">innovating solutions through research!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                Recognizing these challenges, our work began with an extensive review of existing literature and
                methodologies in this field. We analyzed various approaches and understanding their limitations in terms
                of generalization, context learning, and handling complex design structures. These models, while
                groundbreaking, faced issues with overfitting and were restricted by the sequential nature of their
                architectures, limiting their efficiency and scalability. Our exploration didn't stop there; we also
                delved into machine translation techniques, particularly in image captioning and description generation,
                drawing parallels between translating visual content into human language and into structured code.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">the model architecture!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                At the core of our system is the AI model; of course, that is doing the actual work. The process begins
                with
                autoencoders, a specialized neural networks that compress images into a compact, essential
                representation,
                stripping away redundancies while preserving the core structure necessary for code generation.

                But our model doesn't stop there. After the autoencoder, the inputs advances towards the 'main model,' a
                sophisticated structure where the actual translation occurs. By integrating the insights from the
                autoencoders with complex sequential and recurrent neural networks, the model maps out and understands
                the correlation between visual elements and their corresponding code structures.
                The beauty of this design lies in its attention to detail. While the autoencoders focus on images, the
                main model also takes into account DSL (Domain-Specific Language), an intermediate coding language that
                bridges the gap between graphic design and HTML code. This dual-input approach ensures a comprehensive
                understanding of the task at hand, leading to remarkably accurate code generation.

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">the inference!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                The inference involves a unique intermediate step that plays a crucial role in the accuracy and
                efficiency of code generation: the use of Domain Specific Language code.

                When our model analyzes an input image, it doesn't immediately gives out HTML code. Instead, it crafts
                what we refer to as 'intermediatory form' or DSL. This language, specific to the domain of web layouts,
                represents various page elements in a simplified manner. For instance, instead of generating a complete
                header tag filled with HTML content, the model produces a concise DSL command.

                But why add this extra step? The answer lies in the complexity of web design. Directly translating an
                image into HTML code places an immense contextaul learning load on the model, increasing the risk of
                errors and the memorization of code rather than true understanding. DSL, with its more straightforward
                commands, eases this burden significantly. By abstracting the design's essence, our model can focus on
                accurately interpreting the layout's structure and elements without getting halted in the intricacies of
                HTML syntax.

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">the role of the compiler!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                The workflow from image to website doesn't end with DSL. These simplified commands don't mean much to a
                web browser; they need to be translated into a language it understands: the HTML. That's where our
                custom-designed compiler arrives. This dedicated module takes the DSL code generated by our model and
                converts it into functional HTML. The benefit of this system is its adaptability; while we currently
                focus on HTML, the DSL code could be translated into any General-Purpose Language, making our approach
                versatile across various platforms, for example Android and iOS.
