            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                Our paper presents some novel advancements in the image inpainting techniques for small, simple images
                for example from the CIFAR10 dataset. This study primarily targeted on improving the performance of the
                context encoders through the utilsation of several major training methods on Generative Adversarial
                Networks (GANs). To achieve this, we upscaled the network to Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and weighed up
                encoders and discriminators based on the current state-of-the-art models against normal Convolutional
                Neural Network (CNN) architectures.
                Side by side to this, we also explored Latent Variable Models' methods and developed several different
                models, namely Pixel CNN, Diagonal Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Row LSTM.
                Also, we proposed a variation on the Pixel CNN model and developed a simpler and faster model named
                Flattened Row LSTM. Our experiments show that the proposed models generate high-quality images on
                CIFAR10 while conforming the L2 loss and visual quality measurement.
                <br>
                Our contributions demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques in image inpainting on small,
                simple images from CIFAR10. The proposed models and training tricks can be applied to other image
                datasets and have the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in image inpainting.
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">the problem!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                In the expansive field of computer vision, one challenge has consistently stood out due to its
                complexity and potential impact: image inpainting. This technique, essential in restoring old
                photographs and repairing visual content, involves filling in missing or damaged portions of an image in
                a way that is seamless and unnoticeable. The goal is not just to cover the gaps but to understand the
                surrounding pixels' context and regenerate the lost part in harmony with the whole image. Traditional
                methods have halted in maintaining consistency in texture and color, often leaving noticeable
                mismatches that fails the alterations.
            </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">innovating image restoration with deep learning!</span>
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                Our work sought to advance this process by leveraging deep learning, bringing a nuanced understanding of
                images at a latent level. We delved into the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
                specifically adapted the network to a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) framework. This adaptation, coupled with
                strategic training enhancements, fortified our model's ability to handle the softness of image textures
                and colors.

                Parallelly, our exploration extended into density-based methods, where we experimented with Pixel CNN
                and various LSTM configurations. A significant development was the introduction of a unique method we
                called Flattened Row LSTM, simplifying the traditionally complex architectures. This innovation was
                not just about streamlining but also about enhancing the model's interpretability of the image data.
            </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">results: painting a picture of success!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                Our approach demonstrated remarkable proficiency in handling CIFAR10's diverse and colorful images, a
                popular dataset known for its complexity. Not only were we able to seamlessly inpaint the images, but we
                also managed to maintain a delicate balance between L2 loss minimization and visual quality
                preservation, a well known challenge in image restoration endeavors.

                One of the pivotal successes was the model's ability to reconcile the technical and aesthetic aspects of
                image inpainting. The results were visually coherent images, with inpainted sections indistinguishable
                from the original content, showcasing a well blend of art and technology.
            </p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large">future directions: beyond the frame!</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: normal; text-align: justify;">
                While our results are promising, the field of innovation remains vast. Potential future explorations
                include expanding the model's capabilities to handle more complex and higher-resolution images AND
                videos, essential for real-world applications. Furthermore, integrating more advanced GAN and Diffusion
                architectures or delving into unsupervised learning territories could unlock even more sophisticated
                inpainting techniques.

                Another intriguing area is exploring real-time inpainting for video content, a frontier not yet fully
                charted. This advancement could revolutionize film restoration, live broadcasting, and video editing by
                providing tools to repair visual content on-the-fly.
